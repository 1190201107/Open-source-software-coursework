#####1.	Title: 
  Merge entries should be able to merge keywords
#####2.	Description: 
  when merging entries,it should be possible to merge the keywords.so we seek to make the operation of merge implement it to improve logic aspect of Jabref. 
 
#####3.	Scope:
  As i know,its implement focus on the logic of the project which operate and control the entry representing basic element.of course,we reckon that the gui and model need reading and understanding. 

#####4.	Idea : 
1) Add "Use Both" button on the forth column and the ‘Use both’ button appears right of "Use Right" only for keyword. 

2) About Keywords:The entry is indexed according to keywords, and the weight of keyword frequency statistics and entry length normalization is used as the keyword weight. When two entries are merged, if only one keyword is retained, the keyword frequency needs to be re counted for the merged entry and the entry length needs to be re normalized; When two keywords are merged at the same time, the weighted average of the weights of the two keywords in the newly merged entry is taken. The weight is the length of the original entry.
3) Work Plan :Here are our group’s work plan. We divide the whole work into two parts. First,  learn and understand the GUI and model by July 7, understand the logic of the project, and these logical operations and controls represent the basic elements of the entries. And initially complete the above idea, add the "Use both" button on the fourth column, and the "Use Both" button only appears to the right of the keyword "Use Correctly". On The seventh of July, we will meet and discuss according to the actual situation, and adjust it again according to the actual situation. The entries are then indexed according to the keywords, and the weights and entry length normalization of the keyword frequency statistics are used as the keyword weights. Eventually, the entire project will be completed by July 15.
